# Interactive Quiz Application

This repository contains a Python-based interactive quiz application designed to test users' knowledge while showcasing data analysis through API-driven content delivery. The project uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, a graphical user interface (GUI), and an external API to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Question Retrieval**:
  - Utilizes the Open Trivia Database API to fetch quiz questions dynamically.
  - Ensures fresh and varied questions for each quiz session.

- **Interactive GUI**:
  - Built using the Tkinter library in Python for a responsive and intuitive interface.
  - Displays each question with two buttons for user responses (TRUE/FALSE).

- **Score Tracking**:
  - Tracks user performance by updating the score for each correct answer.
  - Displays the final score after all questions are answered.

- **Data Analysis Support**:
  - Demonstrates API integration for dynamic data handling.
  - Provides insights into quiz performance through score tracking and potential enhancements.

## How It Works
1. **Question Retrieval**:
   - The application fetches 10 questions from the Open Trivia Database API.
2. **Interactive Gameplay**:
   - Each question is displayed on the GUI.
   - Users respond by clicking either the TRUE or FALSE button.
3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score is updated in real-time for every correct answer.
   - The final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.
